SRAD

Status: Beta

SRAD (Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion) is an application for safely
removing local correlations of noise (speckles) from ultrasonic and radar
images. This is performed with a diffusion method based on partial differential
equations (PDEs). 

Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite
      (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).

Running
-------

In srad.h, define either GPU or CPU computation.

Usage: srad <rows> <columns> <y1 position of speckle> <y2 position of speckle>
            <x1 position of speckle> <x2 position of speckle> <lambda value>
            <num iterations>

Example: srad 256 256 0 127 0 127 0.5 2

Note: Currently, the GPU implementation can only support x-, y-dimensions that
      can be divided by 16.
      This application is known to have issues on some NVIDIA cards for larger
      numbers of rows and columns.
