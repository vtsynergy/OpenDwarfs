SRAD
====

SRAD (Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion) is a diffusion method for
ultrasonic and radar imaging applications based on partial differential
equations (PDEs). It is used to remove locally correlated noise, known as
speckles, without destroying important image features. 

Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite
      (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).

Running
-------

In srad.h, define either GPU or CPU computation.

Usage: srad <rows> <columns> <y1 position of speckle> <y2 position of speckle>
            <x1 position of speckle> <x2 position of speckle> <lambda value>
            <num iterations>

Example: srad 256 256 0 127 0 127 0.5 2

Note: Currently, the GPU implementation can only support x-, y-dimensions that
      can be divided by 16.
      This application is known to have issues on some NVIDIA cards for larger
      numbers of rows and columns.
