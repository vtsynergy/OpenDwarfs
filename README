OpenDwarfs
=============
The OpenDwarfs project provides a benchmark suite consisting of different
computation/communication idioms, i.e., dwarfs, for state-of-art multicore and
GPU systems.  The first instantiation of the OpenDwarfs has been realized in
OpenCL, as described in part in "OpenCL and the 13 Dwarfs: A Work in Progress"
by Feng, Lin, Scogland, and Zhang in the 3rd ACM/SPEC International Conference
on Performance Engineering, April 2012.


The computation/communication idioms are based on the 13 Berkeley Dwarfs:

Alpha:

Requirements
------------

Packages and libraries needed to build and run the applications.

To build:

    opencl >= 1.0 (some apps require 1.1, but we do not yet guarantee support for 1.2 in all applications.)
    autoconf >= 2.63
    autoheader
    automake
    libtool
    gcc
    maker

To run:

    opencl libs

Building
--------

To build all of the included applications:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make

To build only the applications you select, call configure with the --with-apps
option:

    $ ../configure --with-apps=srad,gem,cfd

To see a full list of options and applications:

    $ ../configure --help

Running
-------

See the application-specific README file in each application's directory.
All the dwarf applications support a common list of options for optionally specifying the OpenCL platform ID (-p) and OpenCL device ID (-d), or alternatively, the device type (-t). These options, if supplied, must follow the executable name and be delimited from the application-specific options by double dashes (--).

General format: ./<executable> [-p <platform> -d <device> | -t <type> --] [app-specific options]

    <platform>	:integer ID of platform to use
    <device>    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>	: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)

Example1: ./astar -p 0 -d 0 --
Example2: ./astar -t 0 --
