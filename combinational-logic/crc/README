Cyclic Redundancy Check
=======================

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error-detecting code which is designed
to detect errors caused by network transmission or any other accidental error.
Specifically, CRC is designed to catch burst errors in data that is transfered.
Polynomial division is performed on the data stream S by the CRC polynomial.
This polynomial is predetermined.  The remainder from this division is the CRC
value.  This value is typically added to the end of the data stream as it is sent
out.  When the reciever divides the recieved datastream, the division will return
no remainder on a successful transmission.

Currently data for this algorithm is created on the spot (using the rand() function).
Also, currently only an 8-bit CRC polynomial is allowed.
If inputing a file, the file will be clipped to 32768 bytes. 

Running
-------

Usage: crc [hsivp]

h         - print this help message
s {seed}  - set the seed for the vertex
i {file}  - take input from file instead of randomly generating code
v         - verify parallel code with serial implementation of crc
p {num}   - change the last 8 bits of the crc polynomial

Example Usage
-------------

#Runs the code on a random data set with no verification
crc

#Runs the code with a specific random seed (1000) and runs the serial version
#of crc to verify correctness.
crc -s 1000 -v

#Runs crc with a modified polynomial
crc -p 7
