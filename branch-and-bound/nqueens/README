N-Queens solver
====================

Status: Beta

The n-queens solver is a backtrack & branch-and-bound application that
provides a solution to the n-queens problem. That is, it tries to find
all the valid placements of n queens on a chessboard of size nxn. This
corresponds to the positions for each of the n queens for each solution,
where no queen can attack another. This takes into account all the valid
movements a queen can make, i.e., move along a column, row, or diagonal,
starting from her current position.

Running
-------

Usage: nqueens [<platform> <device> | <type> --] [options] N

	-cpu: use CPU implementation (single threaded)
	N: the board size (1 ~ 32)

	<platform>	:integer ID of platform to use
    <device>    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>		: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)	
    
Example: ./nqueens 16
