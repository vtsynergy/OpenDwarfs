Temporal Data Mining
====================

Status: Alpha

The Temporal Data Mining(TDM) code is a restricted variant of
association rule data mining.  In this case, temporal data is
also considered as part of the association process.

Usage: tdm <filepath> <temporal constraints path> <threads> <support> <(a)bsolute or (r)atio> <(s)tatic (d)ynamic> <(m)ap and merge or (n)aive or (h)ybrid>

    <filepath>                  :file containing temporal database
    <temporal constraints path> :path containing temporal constraints  
    <threads>                   :maximum number of threads to use      
    <support>                   :culling threshold value                       
    <(a)bsolute or (r)atio>     :culling threshold type                
    <(s)tatic or (d)ynamic>     :static or dynamic memory management
    <(m)ap and merge or (n)aive :algorithm type to use
        or (h)ybrid>
