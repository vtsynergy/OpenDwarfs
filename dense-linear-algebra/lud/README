LU Decomposition
================

Status: Beta

In LU Decomposition, a matrix is decomposed into a product of two matrices,
one a lower triangular matrix and the other an uppper triangular matrix.

Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite
      (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).

Running
-------

Usage: lud [<platform> <device> | <type> --] [options] -i <input_file>

    -i input_file :file containing the original matrix
    -v            :verify the computation and print differences, if any

	<platform>	:integer ID of platform to use
    <device>    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>		: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)	
    
Example: lud -i test/dense-linear-albebra/lud/64.dat
