k-means clustering
==================

Status: Beta

K-means performs a local clustering algorithm to represent a collection of data
objects by means of sub-cluster centroids. Each sub-cluster seed is initally set
randomly or based on a heuristic. Each step of the algorithm computes the
nearest centroid for each data object, then relocates the centroid to the mean
of all objects within the sub-cluster. Execution terminates when no clusters
change size between iterations.


Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite
      (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).

Running
-------

Usage: kmeans [options] -i <filename>

    -i filename      :file containing data to be clustered
    -m max_nclusters :maximum number of clusters allowed    [default=5]
    -n min_nclusters :minimum number of clusters allowed    [default=5]
    -t threshold     :threshold value                       [default=0.001]
    -l nloops        :iteration for each number of clusters [default=1]
    -b               :input file is in binary format
    -r               :calculate RMSE                        [default=off]
    -o               :output cluster center coordinates     [default=off]

Example: kmeans -o -i test/dense-linear-algebra/kmeans/100
