Breadth-first search
====================

Status: Alpha

In Breadth-first search, a graph (comprised of vertices and edges) are read in
from a file.  From this, a single-source shortest-path algorithm is computed.
This algorithm currently assumes that each edge weight is one.  However, the
algorithm should be easily extendable to cover this case.  This particular
program has been ported from the Rodidnia Benchmark Suite. 

Note: This application was ported from the Rodinia Suite
      (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/).
